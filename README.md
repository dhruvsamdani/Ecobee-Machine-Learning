# Ecobee-Machine-Learning

Ecobee Machine Learning is a program that detects the outdoor weather using the Dark Sky API, and detecs the temperature inside my house using the Ecobee API. The data is entered into two files and then plotted over a graph. A regression is then created over the data to predict what the temperature inside the house should be based on the temperature outside. In a perfect world it will predict the temperature that my family would like to keep the house at based on the temperature outside, the weather.
